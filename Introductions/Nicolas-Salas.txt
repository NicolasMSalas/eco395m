Hello, my name is Nicolas Salas. My interests in economics specifically lies in Behavioral Economics, Game Theory, and Industrial Organization. I am new to programming, but I know that there is a lot of value in learning to code in new languages. I hope to learn a lot in this class so I can apply these new skills to a professional setting.
